# Standalone DTB build for the Milk-V Duo S (Sophgo SG2000, aarch64).
#
# Compiles pkgs/firmware/dts/sg2000-milkv-duo-s.dts against the kernel
# source's DTS include tree, mirroring the kernel's own dtb build rule:
#
#   HOSTCC -E -nostdinc -I scripts/dtc/include-prefixes \
#          -undef -D__DTS__ -x assembler-with-cpp <dts> -o <tmp.dts>
#   dtc -I dts -O dtb -i <sophgo-dir> -i scripts/dtc/include-prefixes \
#       <tmp.dts> -o <dtb>
#
# The include-prefixes directory has symlinks for each arch (riscv ->,
# arm64 ->, dt-bindings -> ...) that allow sg2000.dtsi to reach the
# riscv/sophgo cv180x.dtsi and cv181x.dtsi, and the pinctrl header to
# reach include/dt-bindings/. No full kernel rebuild is needed.
#
# Output layout: $out/sophgo/sg2000-milkv-duo-s.dtb
# -> hardware.deviceTree.name = "sophgo/sg2000-milkv-duo-s.dtb"

  # milkv-duo-module-01.dtsi -> sg2000.dtsi) lacks the SoC peripheral nodes
  # (thermal, pwm, efuse, mailbox, i2s, ...). Armbian's DTS patches add them with

  # chain picks the nodes up. The matching DRIVER patches ride the kernel build
