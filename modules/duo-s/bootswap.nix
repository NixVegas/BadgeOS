# Boot-core swap on a long BOOT-button hold. `nix-badge bootswap` watches the
# btn-boot-n GPIO; holding it for >=3s latches the OTHER core (74AUP1G175) and
# reboots -- but only when the board switch is on AUTO (it re-reads the strap and
# reverts if the switch overrides the latch). btn-boot-n is dual-purpose (it's
# also the ROM recovery strap), so this makes the boot button useful in Linux;
# the dedicated USER button (PWR_GPIO1) drives the oled engine separately.
