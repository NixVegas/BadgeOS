# Make deploy-rs (and a manual on-device nixos-rebuild) safe on the dual-core
# badge. See flake.nix `deploy.nodes` for the two targets, one per core.
#
# The badge's FAT boot partition is NOT a stock NixOS /boot. It holds a per-core
# tree built off-device by pkgs/sdcard/make-boot-dir.nix:
#   /fip.bin /fip-arm.bin /fip-riscv.bin
#   /arm/nixos/... /arm/extlinux/extlinux.conf
#   /riscv/nixos/... /riscv/extlinux/extlinux.conf
# Each core's U-Boot reads its OWN /<core>/extlinux/extlinux.conf; only fip.bin
# selects the core. The stock generic-extlinux-compatible installer writes
# generations to the /boot ROOT with ../nixos/ paths, which clobbers this layout
# and leaves the board unbootable.
#
# So override the installer to update ONLY the running core's subtree (kernel +
# extlinux) and its firmware, never the other core's subtree. Firmware is the
# active polyglot fip.bin (#48; boots either core, always refreshed) plus this
# core's recovery fip-<core>.bin. Core switching is latch-only (nix-badge core
# + reboot in AUTO) -- fip.bin is core-agnostic now. The image build is
# unaffected: make-boot-dir.nix calls populateCmd directly, not this installer.
