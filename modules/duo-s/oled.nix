# OLED engine: the nix-badge `oled` daemon drives the SAO OLED with
# Bad Apple (the default wake screen) plus battery/load/power/clock screens, and
# cycles LED patterns on the USER button / SIGUSR1, OLED screens on a long press /
# SIGUSR2.
#
# It owns the OLED + USER button + signals. The WS2812 ring stays with the
# leds.nix painter (which starts in the initrd and survives switch_root, the
# flicker-free early-boot path) -- the oled daemon only rewrites
# /etc/nixbadge/leds.conf to change the ring's pattern, and the painter
# hot-reloads it. So this service does NOT touch spidev and cannot disturb the
# ring's boot animation.
#
# The panel is an OPTIONAL component with a configurable size (see the options
# below): nixbadge.oled.enable gates the whole daemon (off = no OLED, no Bad
# Apple blob in the closure; the ring still animates from leds.nix), and
# width/height are passed to the runtime so a differently-sized 1-bit panel (a
# Sharp Memory display, a 128x64 OLED) works without a code change.

        The fix Engine's GC collection line, in MiB: the heap-reserved size at which an

        (8192 Values), so the per-frame young garbage MUST be collected regularly or it
        grows unbounded and overflows zram into SD swap (measured with the flat Bad Apple:
        budget 768 -> swap climbs past 526 MB, eval re-explodes to 16 s; budget 96 -> swap
        plateaus ~165 MB, eval ~5 ms). So this must sit only modestly above the Engine's
        steady live heap (Engine baseline + the compiled ScreenSet + the flat Bad Apple
        `data` list, together well under 100 MB now that no per-frame frame objects are
        pinned -- see badapple-live.nix). Lower = tighter memory but more frequent
        collection hitches; since collection is major-only (#34) each is ~O(live heap),
        ~100 ms, so a too-low budget adds visible hitches while a too-high one leaks. 128
        balances both and keeps the plateau safely inside zram. (The RIGHT long-term fix
        is a correct CHEAP minor GC so collects are O(garbage), not O(heap) -- then this
        knob barely matters.) fix's automatic line would be 256 MB on this board (too

        engine compiles them ALL ONCE into ONE shared fix Engine (a ScreenSet --
        one Value/chunk heap for the whole set, not one per screen) and applies
        the current one every frame; the USER long-press / SIGUSR2 cycles through
