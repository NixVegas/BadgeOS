# WS2812 LED ring on the Milk-V Duo S badge, driven from SPI3 through spidev.
#
# The service starts in the initrd so the badge shows life as early as
# possible, and it keeps running after switch_root. systemd PID1 serializes
# unit state across a switch-root, so a unit that exists on BOTH sides with the
# same name and the same ExecStart carries over instead of being torn down.
# That is why the unit body below is shared between boot.initrd.systemd.services
# and systemd.services.
#
# The patterns themselves are pure-Nix files (bling.d, cycled by the USER
# button rewriting `eval =`); to change the brightness or the pattern source at
# run time use the CLI:
#   nix-badge bling set --brightness 128 --eval /etc/nixbadge/bling.d/20-fire.nix
# The CLI only writes /etc/nixbadge/leds.conf. The running service watches
# that file and reloads when the mtime moves, so nothing calls systemctl and
# the binary keeps a glibc-only closure. An animation notices within one frame,
# a static pattern within half a second.
#
# A reload takes the brightness, fps and the blob/eval paths. It does NOT reload
# device, count or speedHz: those describe the board, the SPI node is already
# open and the frame buffers are already sized. Change them with a rebuild.

        Ask spidev for SPI_CS_HIGH. Keep this true.

        The badge wires LED_DIN = CS AND SDO through U10, so chip select gates
        the LED data and has to be active HIGH. That is fixed in the device
        tree, not here: spi3 declares

          cs-gpios = <&portb 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>

        with the pad muxed to XGPIOB_16 (mux 3) rather than SPI3_CS (mux 5).

        SPI_CS_HIGH cannot do it. With the native DesignWare chip select,
        dw_spi_set_cs only decides whether to raise the Slave Enable bit, and
        the pad polarity is fixed active-low in hardware. Only a gpiod chip
        select honours polarity. This option is kept purely as an escape hatch.

        SPI clock in Hz. Together with `bits` this sets the LED bit time. The
        driver rounds to an even divisor of ssi_clk, and the service logs the
        timing it actually got.

        The badge chain is mixed XL-1615 and XL-2020, whose T1H window is
        0.9 to 1.0 us, NOT the WS2812B 0.8 us. With ssi_clk at 187.5 MHz and
        bits = 4, 3200000 gives divider 60, so 3125000 Hz: a 320 ns SPI bit,
        T0H 320 ns and T1H 960 ns, which sits inside that window.

        bits = 4 is required to reach it. With bits = 3 a 960 ns T1H would need
        a 480 ns SPI bit, giving a 1440 ns period that is too slow.
