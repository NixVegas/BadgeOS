# Onboard WiFi for the Milk-V Duo S: AICSemi AIC8800D80 on SDIO.
#
# The SDIO controller (mmc@4320000 / sdhci1) uses the mainline dwcmshc cv18xx host
# (see pkgs/firmware/dts/sg2000-milkv-duo-s.dts). The cap-sdio-irq property delivers
# the in-band SDIO interrupt through the sdio_claim_irq path. The aic8800 driver is
# built with usePoll = false so it uses that path. This also keeps the controller
# runtime-resumed, with the clock alive, across the post-START_APP wait.
#
# The driver and firmware come from the radxa-pkg/aic8800 fork. This is the vendor
# driver carried forward to recent mainline kernels through a quilt series. WiFi is
# built only on the ARM core. The SDIO host DTS and power sequence live there.

    # usePoll = false selects the real in-band SDIO IRQ RX path (sdio_claim_irq),
    # not a poll kthread. The AIC8800 needs a 32.768kHz clock to complete fmac
    # init (FSBL SWITCH_32K_XTAL + u-boot CLK32K pinmux). Without that clock the
    # fmac stays dark and does not assert its in-band CARD_INT.
    #
    # With the clock present the fmac completes init, cfg80211 registers, and the
    # vendor SDHCI delivers the in-band CARD_INT, so the sdio_claim_irq path carries
    # all fmac traffic. The old poll/drain path (chip_id hardcode, force-credit,
    # FDRV busrx drain) was for a dead fmac and faults on live RX (NULL deref in
    # rwnx_rx_handle_msg via aicwf_busrx_thr). Keep usePoll = false.
